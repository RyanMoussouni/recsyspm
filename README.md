## Recommendation system based on a graph

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate movie/books recommender system based on user tastes. 

## Data sets 

Goodreads : https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/books
\n MovieLens : https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

## Graph Structure

The graph stores the list of all User Nodes (and Movie Nodes for the movieLens dataset). Edges are stored within the nodes themselves, making it practical to get information about degree or average rating.
