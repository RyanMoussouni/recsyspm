## Recommendation system based on a graph

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate movie recommender system based on user tastes and to be able to explain its decisions.

## Data sets 

MovieLens : https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

## Recommendation

A visualisation of how the recommendation systems work is proposed in the notebooks graph_small.ipynb (MovieLens 100k) and graph_heavy.ipynb (MovieLens 10M).
